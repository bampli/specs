## bAmpli Circuits

Cyclos and Business Amplifiers form **bAmpli Circuits**.

For example, the following circuit shows a bAmpli providing investments to leverage three other distinct Cyclos. It can represent an **Angel** investing in **Startups**, for example.

In this case, when the Angel sells its “product”, the entire Startup is negotiated, disappearing from the diagram and fattening the Angel's net profit!

The bAmpli circuit allows analyzing each Cyclo separately.
