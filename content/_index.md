## bAmpli Circuits

Cyclos and Business Amplifiers form **bAmpli Circuits**, an effective philosophy for business design, planning and management.

Use the most powerful combinations of decision support tools available in history, including **SPC** (Statistical Process Control), **JIT** (Just in Time), **TPM** (Total Productive Maintenance), and **TOC** (Theory of Constraints), among others.

For example, the circuit at left shows four **Business Amplifiers**, each one with its own **Cyclo**, generating **Gain** for the business.

The **Angel** provides the necessary investments to leverage three other distinct **Startups**, each one with its **Cyclo** & **Gain**.

In this case, when the **Angel** sells its *product*, the entire Startup is negotiated, disappearing from the diagram and fattening the Angel's net profit!
