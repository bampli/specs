## Stage Model

The **Stage** revised model shows below the **Facility** resources divided into two categories:

- **FacilityInfra**: includes infrastructure items, like Shop Floor Area, Energy, etc.
- **FacilityOp**: includes operational items with **Skills**, like Tools and Workers.

## Stage Resources

When the **Cyclo** is running, each **Stage** should allocate all necessary **Resources** before receiving the "green" light to be executed. The diagram below shows the allocation, execution and release states for each **Stage**.

### Resource Allocation

- From the **Cyclo** may eventually come **RM**, and **WIP** generated at previous **Stage**.
- **Infrastructure Resources** are obtained from the **Facility**, like Energy and Shop Floor Area.
- The **Skills** indicate **Operational Resources** to be sought in the **Facility**, like Tools and Workers.
- For each required **Resource**, check its availability. If not available, the **Stage** must wait.
- At Resource allocation, there may be a delay due to the **Resource Allocation Time**.
- Before each Stage execution, there may be a delay due to the **Resource Setup Time**.

### Stage Execution

- As soon as resources are allocated and setup, the **Stage** is executed, according to rule three of Deming's **Process** specification: *At each **Stage** there is production, that is, something happens in the set of assets that enter a **Stage**, causing their exit in a different state*.
- The Stage execution expects to introduce a delay known as the **Stage Execution Time**.

### Resource Release

- After execution, the allocated **Resources** may be freed and become available for other **Stages**.
- Any resulting **WIP** must be released for the next **Stage** of the **Cyclo**.
- Remaining Facility allocated **Resources** should be released to **FacilityInfra** and **FacilityOp**.
- At Resource release, there may be a delay due to the **Resource Release Time**.
- Some optimization may prevent **Facility** from eventual unnecessary release/reallocation, according to rule five of Deming's **Process** specification: *Each Stage cooperates with the next and the previous, seeking optimization*.

## Stage Timing
 
The timing during the Resource allocation, execution and release is shown below.

    rect rgb(0, 0, 255, .3)
        Alloc-->>Setup: Resource Allocation Time
    end
    rect rgb(0, 0, 255, .3)
        Setup-->>Execution: Resource Setup Time
    end
    rect rgb(0, 255, 0, .3)
        Execution->>Release: Stage Execution Time
    end
    rect rgb(0, 0, 255, .3)
        Release-->>Free: Resource Release Time
    end
    rect rgb(255, 0, 255, .3)
        Alloc->>Free: Stage Total Time
    end
{{< /mermaid >}}

These times should be specified by the **Process**, since it defines the **Stage** sequence for the **Cyclo**. The actual amount of time each **Stage** will require at run time is ultimately defined by the **Cyclo** and **Facility** implementations. All timing should be analyzed as **statistical distributions**, subject to variations due to existing **common** and **special causes** in the **Process**, according to **SPC** (Statistical Process Control) directives.
