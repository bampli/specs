- with at least one **bAmpli**
- that handles at least one **Cyclo**
- composed by one **Stage** or more.

## COMPANY

The corresponding relationships are outlined below:

- The **Company** has **Investors** that are the shareholders.
- The **Investors** own **Shares** that elect **Company**'s top management.
- The **Facility** in this context is not a building!
- The **Facility** is a commitment to lend. It is like a credit card that entitles the Company to borrow on demand up to a prearranged limit at a predetermined interest rate. When the Company use the card, it creates an outstanding loan, and each additional charge is a drawdown against the Facility that increases the loan. Finally the Company pays the loan principal, and may also pay an annual fee for the privilege of having the Facility, independently of the loan. This definition is inspired by Eric Evans "Domain Driven Design" book, seen at chapter eight.
- The **Facility** designs the **bAmpli Circuit** in order to manage the **Process**.
- The **bAmpli Circuit** is an abstraction implemented by the **Company**, similar to an electronic circuit schematic that may be applied to different equipment.
- The **bAmpli Circuit** is composed of at least one **bAmpli**, or Business Amplifier.
- The **bAmpli** is responsible for at least one **Cyclo**, or Gain Machine.
- The **Cyclo** is composed of at least one **Stage**.
