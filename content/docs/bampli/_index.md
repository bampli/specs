## bAmpli: Business Amplifier

The Plan consists of managing a **Cyclo** feeding the **bAmpli** with its respective **Gain**. The "**+**" symbol at the top represents the investor. In addition to the Plan, the system also captures the naked Reality.

The role of the Administration is to confront **Plan** & **Reality**, promoting the actions of managers and investors to fix any differences. Operating Expenses should  cover the Labor and Overhead costs.

**Administration** has positive and negative inputs. The Cyclo is something expected to happen, which means the positive input. If reality reveals a disparity at the negative input, an action must be taken. For example, when Gain is negative, it is necessary to inject Investment, in order to keep Cyclo spinning.
