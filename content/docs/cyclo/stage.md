# Stage

When the **Cyclo** is running, each **Stage** should allocate all required **Resources**, before receiving the "green" light to execute.

## State

- **FREE**: Stage that requires Skills is created at Facility and available.
- **ALLOC**: Stage is allocating Resources from Facility Infrastrucure & Operation.
- **SETUP**: Stage with Skills satisfied, preparing to initiate Production.
- **READY**: Stage is ready for Production, getting the WiP.
- **EXEC**: Stage is effectively transforming the WiP.
- **WIP**: Stage is putting the transformed WiP.
- **RELEASE**: Stage is releasing Resources from Facility Infrastrucure & Operation.

Some optimization may prevent unnecessary release/reallocation delays, according to rule five of Deming's **Process** specification: *Each Stage cooperates with the next and the previous, seeking optimization*.

## Time Distributions

During its lifespan within the [**Working Time**](/posts/tpm), the **Stage** should evaluate the following *elapsed time* frequency distributions:

- **StageFreeTime**: Time the Stage is freely available at Facility.
- **ResourceAllocTime**: Time spent allocating Resources from Facility.
- **StageSetupTime**: Time spent with Stage setup.
- **StageReadyTime**: Time the Stage is ready for Production.
- **ResourceReleaseTime**: Time spent decomissioning the Stage.

*WorkingTime = StageFreeTime + ResourceAllocTime + StageSetupTime + StageReadyTime + ResourceReleaseTime* 

But StageReadyTime, which means the **Stage** is ready for Production, can be split even more:

- StageGetWipTime: Time to get the necessary WiPs from previous Stage.
- StageExecTime: Time the Stage takes to effectively transform the WiP.
- StagePutWipTime: Time to put properly the WiP for the next Stage.

*StageReadyTime = StageGetWipTime + StageExecTime + StagePutWipTime*  

## Timing

The following diagram represents the timeline including all states:
