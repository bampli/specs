# Stage

When the **Cyclo** is running, each **Stage** should allocate all required **Resources**, before receiving the "green" light to execute.

## State

- **FREE**: Stage that requires Skills is created at Facility and free to use.
- **ALLOC**: Stage is allocating Resources from Facility Infrastrucure & Operation.
- **SETUP**: Stage with Skills satisfied, preparing to start Production.
- **READY**: Stage is ready for Production, maybe now EXEC or IDLE.
- **RELEASE**: Stage is releasing Resources from Facility Infrastrucure & Operation.

Some optimization may prevent unnecessary release/reallocation delays, according to rule five of Deming's **Process** specification: *Each Stage cooperates with the next and the previous, seeking optimization*.

## Time Distributions

During its lifespan within the [**Working Time**](/posts/tpm), the **Stage** should evaluate the following *elapsed time* frequency distributions:

- **StageFreeTime**: Time the Stage is freely available available at Facility.
- **ResourceAllocTime**: Time spent allocating Resources from Facility.
- **StageSetupTime**: Time spent with Stage setup.
- **StageReadyTime**: Time the Stage is ready for Production.
- **ResourceReleaseTime**: Time spent decomissioning the Stage.

*WorkingTime = StageFreeTime + ResourceAllocTime + StageSetupTime + StageReadyTime + ResourceReleaseTime* 

But StageReadyTime, which means the **Stage** is ready for Production, can be split even more:

- StageGetWipTime: Time to get the necessary WiPs from previous Stage.
- StageExecTime: Time the Stage takes to effectively transform the WiPs.
- StagePutWipTime: Time to put properly the WiP for the next Stage.
- StageIdleTime: Time the Stage is ready for Production, but idle due to WiP shortage.

*StageReadyTime = StageGetWipTime + StageExecTime + StagePutWipTime + StageIdleTime*  

## Workflow

The diagram below shows the allocation, execution and release phases for each **Stage**.
