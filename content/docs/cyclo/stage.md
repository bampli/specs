# Stage

When the **Cyclo** is running, each **Stage** should allocate all required **Resources**, before receiving the "green" light to execute.

## State

- **FREE**: Stage that requires Skills is created at Facility and available.
- **ALLOCATION**: Stage is allocating Resources from Facility Infrastructure & Operation.
- **SETUP**: Stage with Skills satisfied, preparing to initiate Production.
- **READY**: Stage is ready for Production, getting the WiP.
- **EXEC**: Stage is effectively transforming the WiP.
- **WIP**: Stage is putting the WiP.
- **RELEASE**: Stage is releasing Resources from Facility Infrastructure & Operation.

Some optimization may prevent unnecessary release/reallocation delays, according to rule five of Deming's **Process** specification: *Each Stage cooperates with the next and the previous, seeking optimization*.

## Time Distributions

During its lifespan within the [**Working Time**](/posts/tpm), the **Stage** should evaluate the following *elapsed time* [frequency distributions](/posts/stats):

- **FreeTime**: Time the Stage is freely available at Facility.
- **AllocationTime**: Time spent allocating Resources from Facility.
- **SetupTime**: Time spent with Stage setup.
- **ReadyTime**: Time the Stage is ready for Production.
- **ReleaseTime**: Time spent decomissioning the Stage.

*WorkingTime = FreeTime + AllocationTime + SetupTime + ReadyTime + ReleaseTime* 

The **ReadyTime**, when the **Stage** is ready for Production, can be split even more:

- **GetWipTime**: Time to gather the necessary **WiP**.
- **ExecTime**: Time the Stage takes to effectively transform the **WiP**.
- **PutWipTime**: Time the Stage takes to put properly the **WiP**.

*ReadyTime = GetWipTime + ExecTime + PutWipTime*  

## Timing

The following diagram represents the timeline including all states:
