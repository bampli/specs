# Times of Gain

The actual amount of time each **Stage** will require at run time is defined by the **Process**, responsible for the **Cyclo** design, and counting on with support provided by the **Facility**. All timing should be analyzed as **statistical distributions**, subject to variations due to existing **common** and **special causes** in the **Process**, according to **SPC** (Statistical Process Control) and [**TPM**](/posts/tpm/) (Total Productive Maintenance) directives.

The **Stage** timing includes the four phases listed below:

- resources allocation
- setup
- execution
- resources release

The following diagram represents the timeline including all phases:

### Resource Allocation

- From the **Cyclo** may eventually come and go assets like **WiP**.
- **Infrastructure** are **Resources** supported by the **Facility**, like Energy and Shop Floor Area.
- The **Skills** indicate **Operational Resources** to be sought in the **Facility**, like Tools and Workers.
- For each required **Resource**, check its availability. If it's not available, the **Stage** awaits.
- At **Resource** allocation phase, there may be a delay due to the **Resource Allocation Time**.

### Stage Setup
- Before each **Stage** execution, there may be a delay due to the **Stage Setup Time**.
- This delay is defined by the **Process** & **Facility**, including tool setup for example.

### Stage Execution

- **Stages** execute transformations according to Deming's **Process** specification: *At each **Stage** there is production, that is, something happens in the set of assets that enter a **Stage**, causing their exit in a different state*.
- The Stage execution expects to introduce a delay known as the **Stage Execution Time**.

### Resource Release

- After execution, allocated **Resources** should be available to another **Stage**.
- Any resulting **WiP** must be released to the next **Stage** in the **Cyclo**.
- **Resources** allocated from the Facility are eventually released to **FacilityInfra** & **FacilityOp**.
- At **Resource** release phase, there may be a delay due to the **Resource Release Time**.
