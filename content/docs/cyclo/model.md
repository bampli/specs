These rules apply to a **Planet** populated by **Products**, made by a **Cyclo** in a **Process** deployed across a **Facility** managed by a **Company**.

- The **Process** is specified by **Cyclos**, grouped in **Stages**.
- The **Facility** provides infrastructural & operational **Resources**. 
- **Stage** and **WiP** (Work In Process) are first class citizens of **Cyclo**.
- The **Stage** allocates **Resources** to accomplish its task.
- Every **Stage** requires **Skills** to accomplish its task.
- The **Skill** is provided by a combination of **People** and/or **Tools**.
- The **Stage** buys **Product** from **Planet** as **WiP**.
- The **Stage** transforms **WiP** through the **Cyclo**.
- The **Stage** sells **Product** to **Planet** as **WiP**.
- **WiP** becomes **Product** that becomes **WiP** at another **Cyclo**.

The **Stage**, detailed below, allocates **Facility** resources divided into two categories:

- **Facility Infrastructure**: includes items like Shop Floor Area, Energy, Equipment, etc.
- **Facility Operation**: includes operational items with **Skills**, like **People** and **Tools**.
