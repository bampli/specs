# Model

The following rules apply to a **Planet** populated by **Products**, made by a **Process** that may extract Raw Material **RM** from the **Planet**.

- The **Process** is specified by **Cyclos** that are grouped in **Stages**.
- The **Facility** provides infrastructural & operational **Resources**. 
- **Stages** consumes **Resources**, both from **Facility** and from **Cyclo**.
- The **Stage** allocates **Resources** from the **Facility** to accomplish its task.
- Every **Stage** requires **Skills** to accomplish its task.
- The **Skill** is provided by a combination of **Workers** and/or **Tools**.
- The **Stage** also allocates **Resources** from the **Cyclo** to accomplish its task.
- The **Stage** extracts **RM** from **Planet** as Work In Process **WiP**.
- The **Stage** transforms **WiP** through the **Cyclo** until it becomes **Product**.
- **Product** and **RM** are both derived from **WiP**, with some logistic between them.
- **WiP** becomes **Product** that may become **RM** to another **Cyclo**.

The **Stage**, detailed below, allocates **Facility** resources divided into two categories:

- **FacilityInfra**: includes infrastructure items, like Shop Floor Area, Energy, etc.
- **FacilityOp**: includes operational items with **Skills**, like Tools and Workers.
