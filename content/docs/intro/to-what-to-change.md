# To what to change?

Every 30 years, since the invention of Henry Ford's **factory process** one century ago in 1920, there have been major transformations in process management.

William Deming in the 50's started a revolution in Asian countries with the  **Statistical Process Control**, followed by **Just inTime** introduced by Toyota, and **Total Productive Maintenance** created by Seiichi Nakajima.

In the 80's, Eli Goldratt, author of the literary success "The Goal", brought Westerners back to the top with the widely used **Theory of Constraints**.

These initiatives had so far brought together strong and valuable allies. Incorporating concepts originated from **SPC**, **JIT**, **TPM**, and **TOC** leads to one of the most powerful combinations of decision support tools ever assembled in history.
